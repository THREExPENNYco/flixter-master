Flixter is a tutorial marketplace built with Ruby on Rails. Users are able to view and upload tutorials. Additionally, users are able to charge for their tutorials, if they choose to do so. A goal on the front end was dynamic reordering of courses. This was achieved by using jQuery drag and drop, as well as, the [Ranked Model](https://github.com/mixonic/ranked-model) gem.
